# testo-plugin Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Test metadata (`testMetadata` service messages) shows in its own *Metadata* channel tab instead of polluting the
  output: numeric grids become sortable unit-aware tables with bar/line/pie charts, links/images/artifacts become
  clickable cards.
- Metadata images and artifacts are copied into the run history, so a replay keeps them after the original files change.

## [2026.7.262] - 2026-08-18

### Added

- The run configuration writes an HTML report (`--log-html`, on by default) and a JUnit report (`--log-junit`, off)
  into an IDE-managed folder on every run; both are kept in the run history, and HTML opens in a tab.
- The run configuration chooses which coverage reports a Coverage run asks Testo for: Clover, Cobertura, coverage-xml.
- A Coverage run applies every report it produced on its own, one per format.
- The Coverage button on the test toolbar gathers every announced report under one click, with a checkbox per report.
- The Coverage panel gained expand/collapse, an editor-highlighting switch, report-format badges, and a column
  counting the tests that cover each file.
- *Run Covering Tests* on the Coverage panel runs, with coverage, the tests covering the selected file or directory.
- *Select Opened File* on the Coverage panel selects the file open in the editor.
- A gutter icon on every covered method, function and class lists its covering tests, runnable together or one at a
  time, with a switch on the Coverage panel.
- The popup on a covered line highlights the row under the pointer and runs all of that line's covering tests.
- The covering-tests lens on a covered declaration leads its list with *Run all covering tests*, then a jump to each.
- Every run is archived — output, reports and parameters — and replays from *Test History* as a full Testo console.
- *Show history* above a test pops up the archived runs containing it (the one already open in a tab in bold); each
  entry offers *Load replay* (opens the archive and selects the test's node) and *Repeat run* (re-executes it), so a
  bare click never launches anything.
- How many runs the history keeps is set in *Tools | Testo* or from the history list itself, which also clears it.
- *Expand All* / *Collapse All* now sit on the toolbar itself, next to *Show Passed* / *Show Ignored*.
- A tab opened from the history reruns with the executor the archived run used.
- A *Replay* button exports the run as one archive, imports one back, reveals its folder, and sets what the history
  may do with it: keep, drop or lock.
- Every report a run announces is archived with it — HTML with its assets — so a replay opens its own reports.
- The history list bolds the run the tab shows, marks locked runs, and gives each entry the icon of its kind.
- An imported run comes in locked, so retention never deletes it.
- The run configuration keeps its coverage settings in a group of their own: the analysis level (`--coverage-level`,
  or *auto*) and coverage-only options (`--type=!bench` by default).
- Group and Exclude group are lists of tags, picked from the `#[Group]` names the project declares.
- Suite is a list of tags too; a run may narrow to several suites at once, one `--suite` flag each.
- The run configuration is laid out in groups: Parallel under Test Runner Options, then Run Options, Filter and
  Coverage.

### Removed

- The Repeat field — Testo's command line has no `--repeat`.
- The Command field — a test run is always `testo run`; other subcommands are what *Run Anything* is for.
- Parallel no longer sends a flag Testo does not have: the field is parked at 1 until it does.

### Changed

- A Coverage run at level *auto* now collects branch coverage when the engine is Xdebug and a Cobertura report is on.
- The *Log Levels* filter is now a minimum-level picker: an `info +` combo box at the right of the channel tabs row
  shows that level and everything above it (default `info`), instead of per-level checkboxes.
- The channel console keeps the open channel when you change the log level or switch tests, reselecting the same-named
  tab after the rebuild; Output now leads the tabs, apart from the channel-aggregating *All*.

### Fixed

- The data-provider indexer no longer queries the global PHP index while indexing a file (it resolved an abstract
  base class's subclasses), which could trip "Outdated stub in index" and a cascade of IDE internal errors.
- A class inheriting `#[Test]` from its base is recognized as a case: gutters on the inheritor and its public methods.
- Running a method of an abstract case through the inheritor chooser now runs `Inheritor::method` instead of the
  inheritor's whole file.
- The *Show history* lens shows again (it never did on Windows): the lens built its location from the OS-native path
  (`D:\…`) while the archive stored Testo's `D:/…`, so nothing matched. Locations are now compared with unified path
  separators, and the archive index is built when the lens is first asked rather than on a later repaint.
- The two Code Vision lenses (test history, covering tests) now carry a name and description in *Settings | Editor |
  Inlay Hints | Code Vision* instead of showing up blank.
- The debug toolbar has its rerun/restart button back, during the session and after it ends; while the session runs
  it wears the restart-debugger icon.
- Starting a debug session no longer logs a *split debugger* error: the run descriptor now comes off the session
  builder's result instead of the deprecated `XDebugSession.getRunContentDescriptor()`.
- The Test Runner Options help button opens Testo's CLI reference.
- The channel console no longer throws an EDT-threading error while streaming live output into an aggregate tab.
- The report buttons no longer trigger a "slow operations on EDT" error.
- The elapsed time in the run summary no longer counts up forever when a run ends before the toolbar is wired.
- Clearing the history updates the *Replay* menu of the run it spares to *Do not keep in history*.
- The first coverage run of an IDE session paints the editor right away.
- Lists of covering tests name the test class without its namespace.
- Excluding a group runs again: it goes out as `--group=!name`.

## [2026.5.262] - 2026-08-12

### Added

- Report buttons on the test toolbar — one per report Testo announces, opening it in a JCEF tab or the browser.
- A report can open on its own once the run delivers it: armed by a click during the run, or standing per project /
  every project, independently per way of opening.
- The report menu also shows the file in the file manager and copies its path.
- Reports written behind a remote interpreter or in a container are reached through the PHP path mapper.

### Fixed

- The toolbar run summary no longer jitters in width as its counters tick.

## [2026.4.262] - 2026-08-10

### Added

- The test toolbar ends with a run summary: a progress ring that turns into the run's verdict, the finished/total
  count, one counter per Testo status and the elapsed time. Statuses come from the `status` attribute of Testo's
  service messages, so all eight cases of `Testo\Core\Value\Status` are told apart; a Testo too old to send it still
  gets counters, from the three outcomes TeamCity has always carried.
- Every counter filters the test tree: click one to see only tests with that status, click it again or click the
  total to bring the whole tree back. Hovering the total shows how many assertions the run made.
- A selected counter owns the tree while it is selected rather than narrowing the standing *Show passed* /
  *Show ignored* toggles further; releasing it puts the tree back under them.
- *Show passed* and *Show ignored* now read Testo's statuses. Hiding the passed ones takes flaky along but leaves
  **risky**, which used to arrive as a plain pass; hiding the ignored ones takes cancelled along with skipped.
- The tree's root node carries the run's verdict, read from the summary rather than worked out again.
- The clock's hover breaks the run into startup, the tests themselves and post-processing, and sums the tests' own
  durations beside them — only where that sum parts with the window they fitted into. With tests on fibers it runs
  past that window, and the difference is read as a concurrency boost, stated as a floor (`≥2.1x`).
- A problem Testo raises about the run itself rather than about a test — `##teamcity[buildProblem …]`, as an empty
  run reports — is now shown: a red line in Output, a run-level notice in All, and a notification. Once per
  `identity`.
- A node announced with `testSuite` and `testType` keeps them on rerun: `--suite` and `--type` are added the way the
  node itself was narrowed. Optional, so a Testo that sends neither runs exactly as before.
- The results tree carries one icon per Testo status, group nodes included — off the outcome Testo rolls up onto
  their `testSuiteFinished`. A test still running keeps its animation.
- A test's `metainfo` — its PHPDoc summary — shows as the tooltip of its node in the results tree.

### Fixed

- Rerunning a data set or a case from the results tree runs that data set or case, not its whole file. The node's own
  hint spells out the selector (`\Ns\Calculator::med:3:0`), but PHP declares no such member, so it resolved to the
  class; the selector now goes to `--filter` verbatim, class and all.
- No more "Cannot find '…' in '….php'" stopping a run that Testo would have executed. That check assumed the Method
  field names a member the file declares, but it holds a `--filter` selector — `med:1:0`, `\Ns\Case`,
  `\Ns\freeFunction` — that PHP declares nothing under. Whether a filter matches anything is Testo's call.
- Jump to Source on a data set node opens the test it belongs to: the coordinates are taken off the hint before the
  lookup, and a standalone function is looked for even in a file that also holds a class.
- The toolbar run summary follows the IDE's zoom. Its cells are painted by hand and took the label font once, and
  nothing reinstalls a font on a component that has no UI delegate.
- The spinner on a running test follows the IDE's zoom too. The platform's caches its rasterized frames under the
  icon's colour alone, so the tree draws its own where the sizes disagree; the cache key is fixed upstream in
  [IJPL-252440](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IJPL-252440).
- A Testo older than 0.10.39 no longer floods the IDE with internal errors. Such a build sends no node ids, so the
  run now stops at the first such message and says what to update instead.

## [2026.3.1] - 2026-08-04

### Added

- Rector rules carrying `#[\Testo\Bridge\Rector\Testing\TestRectorFixtures]` are recognized as test cases: gutter run
  icon, test-file icon, no "unused" warnings, and a run from the attribute that narrows to `--type=rector-fixture`.
  The rule's own public methods stay ordinary methods — only its fixtures are tests.
- Running a class-level attribute now narrows the run to that attribute's type (`#[Test]` → `--type=test`), while
  running the class itself stays untyped and keeps everything the class holds.
- Gutter run icon on `#[\Testo\Filter\Group]`: runs every test of that group with `--group=<name>` and nothing else —
  no path or name filter is added. A variadic `#[Group('db', 'slow')]` emits one `--group` flag per name.
- The Group / Exclude group fields of the run configuration accept several comma-separated names. Names are stored
  as a list, so a group name is passed to the CLI verbatim; configurations saved in the previous format are migrated
  on load.
- Inspection: suspicious `#[Group]` names are highlighted — blank or whitespace-padded, `!`-prefixed (the CLI reads
  that as an exclusion), containing a comma, or no names at all.
- Initial scaffold created from [IntelliJ Platform Plugin Template](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-platform-plugin-template)

### Fixed

- Concurrent tests no longer nest inside one another in the test tree: the tree is built from the `nodeId`/`parentNodeId`
  Testo reports rather than from the order messages arrive in.
